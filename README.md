# Introduction

	* This is a test project used to learn how express.js works

	The purpose of this application was to give me the opportunity to see how express works, most especially how the concept of MVC works, manage routes, modularize your server side codes, how to consume APIs, how to persist for data, how to create your own API (Although I still have a lot to learn here). etc.

	This project taught me alot, helped me practice a lot and what is left for me now is to get my hands dirty with a project that is not a TODO project.

# DOC

	** To run this application, 
	clone this repo, 
	run 'npm install' to install all th dependencies used and then
	run 'node index.js' to start the application.
	you can navigate to 'localhost:3030/about' to see get your fortune cookies for the day
	you can go to 'localhost:3030/contest/vacation-photo' to unpload photos and save it locally.
	and of course the 'localhost:3030/' will take you to the home page.


# Note

	This application is really basic, and has no functionality aside being able to upload a picture that will be saved in the /data subdirectory of this cloned repo. And this is because I was picking and choosing what I wanted to implement in the book I was reading so there are not alot of front end interaction.
